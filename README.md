# IRIS Student Dashboard Redesigned

A modern, responsive student dashboard inspired by the NITK IRIS portal â€” redesigned with a cleaner UI and improved usability.  
Built using **HTML, CSS (Flexbox + Grid)**, and **JavaScript**, this project showcases a polished, real-world interface for academic tracking and student information.

## Design Rationale

The goal of this design is to reimagine the IRIS student dashboard into a **modern, visually appealing, and easy-to-navigate interface**.  

### Design Vision
- **Clarity and Readability:** Data such as attendance, grades, and schedule are displayed using structured cards and color-coded indicators.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important sections like CGPA, Semester Info, and Attendance stand out through gradient cards and font emphasis.
- **User Comfort:** A dark theme with soft gradients minimizes eye strain and enhances contrast.
- **Responsiveness:** The entire layout adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox and Grid, ensuring usability across desktops and tablets.

- **Attendance Overview** with subject-wise data  
- **Dynamic Schedule Section** with weekly layout  
- **Interactive Hover Effects** and gradients on all cards  
- **Responsive Design** that works across screen sizes  
- **Ready for JavaScript integration** (for real data later)
